### Ellipse Area Calculation using Integrals

The ellipse is defined by the equation:

\[ \frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 \]

where \( a \) is the semi-major axis length and \( b \) is the semi-minor axis length. The area \( A \) of the ellipse can be found using the integral:

\[ A = \int_{-a}^{a} 2b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}} \, dx \]

### Steps to Calculate

1. **Symmetry**: Due to the symmetry of the ellipse, you only need to calculate the area of one quadrant and multiply by 4.

2. **Integral Setup**: The integral from 0 to \( a \) will represent one quadrant:

   \[ A = 4 \int_{0}^{a} b \sqrt{1 - \frac{x^2}{a^2}} \, dx \]

3. **Simplification**: With a substitution \( x = a \sin(\theta) \), the integral becomes easier to solve:

   \[ A = 4b \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} a \cos(\theta) \cdot a \cos(\theta) \, d\theta \]

   \[ A = 4ab \int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}} \cos^2(\theta) \, d\theta \]

4. **Result**: Solving gives:

   \[ A = \pi ab \]

This is the well-known formula for the area of an ellipse.
